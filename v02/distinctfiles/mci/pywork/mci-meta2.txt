mci-meta2.txt
Feb 11, 2018

This supercedes mci-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization mci.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

mci.txt contains digitization of the preface, and seven sections of entries,
additions and corrections following each of the sections, and an index to
the entries.
The following descriptions generally apply to the entry sections only, not
to the other sections.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 
{#X#}  : Devanagari text in slp1 transcoding. (8 in title section, 2 in entries)
{??}   : Unreadable text. 5 instances.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

<sup>N</sup>  Superscript text for homonyms and homonym references.
Often line breaks have semantic significance.
   Two types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb">  Line break
<div n="P">   Line break with indentation


Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>1<pc>001-a<k1>akarkara<k2>akarkara
{@Akarkara@}¦ m.: A mythical serpent.
<div n="P">Son of Kadrū, listed among her sons by
<div n="lb">Sūta at the request of Śaunaka 1. 31. 15, 2.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (a digit sequence). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
In general, a page number has form [PageX+ n], 
where X is the page number of the following page (or page-column), 
and 'n' is the number of lines pertaining to X.
X has one of several forms:
00-PP    for the Preface; PP from 01 to 43
PPP-c     body of text; PPP from 001 to 981 , and = 'a' or 'b' (column)
PPP-sc    where s is 1 or 2.  A few pages with multiple 'sections'.


Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.

This generally agrees with the printed text, except:
We use 'ṃ' for anusvara, instead of the author's ṁ.

The headwords are alphabetized in Sanskrit alphabetical order
within each of the seven sections.
