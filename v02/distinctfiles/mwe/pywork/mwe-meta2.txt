mwe-meta2.txt
Feb 26, 2018

This supercedes mwe-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization mwe.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

mwe.txt contains digitization of the entire text consisting of front matter,
entries, and appendix.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari text, in SLP1 transliteration
{%X%}  : italic text 
{??}   : Unreadable text. 1 instance, in preface

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

Types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb"/>  Line break

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>3<pc>001-a<k1>abandon<k2>abandon
<div n="lb"/>{%To%} ABANDON¦, {%v. a.%} {#tyaj#} (c. 1. {#tyajati, tyaktuM#}), {#parityaj, santyaj; hA#} (c. 3.
<div n="lb"/>{#jahAti, hAtuM#}), {#apahA, vihA, prahA, apAhA; utsfj#} (c. 6. {#-sfjati, -srazwuM#}),
<div n="lb"/>{#atisfj, vyapasfj; ujJ#} (c. 6. {#ujJati, ujJituM#}), {#projJ#}.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (not present in mwe.txt). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[Pageppp-c+ n]
where
  ppp is 3-digit page number (pagination starts anew for each volume)
  c = column.  a or b, indicating first or secondcolumn.
  n = number of lines in the following column of text.
Page breaks in the preface are of form
[PageP+ n]  where P is 2 through 17, except
[Page5-c+ n], where c is a,b, or c.

The lines of the digitization represent lines of the text.

The headwords for the entries are in English alphabetical order.
The Appendix also contains entries, which are separately alphabetized.

Most Sanskrit words are represented in Devanagari, which is coded as {#X#},
where X is is SLP1 transliteration.

Some Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.
There are some disagreements with modern IAST (e.g. 'sh' instead of 'ṣ').
