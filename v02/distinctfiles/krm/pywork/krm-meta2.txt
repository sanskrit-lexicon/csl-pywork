krm-meta2.txt
Jan 28, 2018

This supercedes krm-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization krm.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

krm.txt contains digitization of the preface, the body of entries,
and several appendices.  Within the entries, there is a section of
corrections; also there is a second set of corrections within the
appendices.   The following descriptions apply to the entries only, not
to the preface, corrections, or appendices.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<s>X</s> Sanskrit text, in SLP1 transcoding.
<note n="1"/>  A flag indicating unusually formatted text, where semantically
   linear text is presented in more than one line.
<Poem>X</Poem>  Occurs twice
<sup>N</sup>  Footnote indicator
<F>X</F>      Footnote.  Footnotes appear at the end of entries.
Often line breaks have semantic significance, such as indicating the
   row of a table. Three types of line break divisions are indicated, although
   the distinction among these types is not currently understood.
<div n="lb">  Line break
<div n="NI">  Line break
<div n="P">   Line break

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>1<pc>0003<k1>aka<k2>aka
(1) {@<s>“aka kuwilAyAM gatO”</s>@}¦ (<s>I-BvAdiH</s>-792 <s>sakarmakaH-sew-parasmEpadI) GawAdiH mit .</s>
 ...
<LEND>


The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). [Currently not used]

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PagePPPP +NN] where
PPPP is the page number, and
NN is the number of lines in the original digitization of the entry.  Due to
reorginaztion of Footnotes in this version of digitization, the NN number is
probably without significance.

All of the headwords and text of entries are in either Devanagari or English.
The Devanagari text is coded in SLP1, within the <s> tag, as mentioned.
