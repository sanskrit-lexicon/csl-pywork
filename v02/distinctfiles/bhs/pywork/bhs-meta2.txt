bhs-meta2.txt
Jan 30, 2018

This supercedes bhs-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization bhs.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<lang n="greek">X</lang>  2 X in Greek unicode (X currently empty - not coded)
<div n="lb">  line break
<H>     40  : Headline, letter breaks

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>3<pc>001,1<k1>aMSaDAtrI<k2>aMSa-DAtrI<h>2
[2 {@aṃśa-dhātrī@}¦, see {@aṃsa-@}].
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PagePPP-C+ NN] where
PPP is page number
C  is column (a or b)
NN is the number of lines in the column of the page.   
The lines in the entry bodies correspond to lines of printed text.
For pages with a letter break per page, the coding is
[PagePPP-1C+ NN]; similarly if there are 2 or 3 letter breaks in a page.

Words using diacritics with the Latin alphabet are represented in Unicode 
characters. The vast majority of such words with diacritics are Sanskrit or 
Pali.  There are also several words in German, French, etc. with diacritics.
The Sanskrit words are not distinguished typographically from words in English
or other languages.

The spelling aims to be modern IAST unicode,
generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration; the use of diacritics in the printed text already
corresponds almost exactly with that of modern IAST.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in the text.
with their  frequency as of this writing (01-30-2018):
