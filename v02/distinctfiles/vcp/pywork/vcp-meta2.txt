vcp-meta2.txt
August 16, 2017. This supercedes vcp-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization vcp.txt.

The {X...X} style of coding serves one  in vcp.txt:
{??} 46  : Unreadable text

The lines of the digitization correspond to lines of the printed text.
All of the text is Devanagari, which is currently coded in the SLP1 
transliteration in vcp.txt.

The <> style of coding is used as follows:
<>   355827  :  At beginning of 'normal' lines, other than the first line
                of an entry
<H>    66  : At start of line. A 'headline' (various usage)
<P>  2331  : At start of line, indicating a paragraph indentation
<Picture> 71 : Diagrams in text
The rest are 'Column' indicators for textual tabular arrays:
<C1>...<C12>

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>3<pc>001-a<k1>afRin<k2>afRin
<H>a
<L>1<pc>0035,a<k1>a<k2>a
a¦ pu0 avati rakzati atati sAtatyetra tizWatIti vA ava--ata--
<>vA qa . vizRO “akArovizRuruddizwOkArastu maheSvaraH .
<>makArastu smftobrahmA praRavastu trayAtmaka” iti . asya
<>(vizRoH) apatyam ata iY iH (kAmaH) asya (vizRoH)
<>patnI NIp I (lakzmIH) .
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in vcp dictionary.

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[Page0035-a+ 31] indicating page 35, column a (1st col.), 31 lines in column.
The pagination is continuous through all 6 volumes; The last dictionary
page is [Page5441-b+ 31].

A handful of page designations don't follow this pattern:
[Page1595+ 37]  a table, so not two columns
[Page1596+ 31]  ditto
[Page2764+ 39]  A table, but Columns not marked (correct?) 


The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering.
However, about 2% of the identified headwords are out of alphabetical order.

The introduction is not coded in vcp.txt; it appears in the separate file
vcp-preface.txt.  A page and a half ending section appears in the separate
file vcp-end.txt.

There is no IAST coding in vcp.txt

There is no Anglicized Sanskrit coding in vcp.txt.
There is no AS coding in vcp.txt.

Scanned images, in pdfs vcp_title and vcp1_bookmark are from Thomas Malten;
 vcp2_bookmark, ..., vcp6_bookmark) are
almost all from //archive.org downloads, as files
vacaspatyam02tarkuoft.pdf, ..., vacaspatyam06tarkuoft.pdf.
However, a few (12) pages missing from these last 5 archive.org pdfs 
 were obtained from
the high-resolution scans used for digitization by Malten.


There are several extended ascii codes in vcp.txt.

¦  (\u00a6) 48353 := BROKEN BAR
‘  (\u2018)   248 := LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
’  (\u2019)   249 := RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK
“  (\u201c) 76768 := LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
”  (\u201d) 76493 := RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK
„  (\u201e)     2 := DOUBLE LOW-9 QUOTATION MARK
