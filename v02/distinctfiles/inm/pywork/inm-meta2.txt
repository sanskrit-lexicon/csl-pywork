inm-meta2.txt
Feb 10, 2018

This supercedes inm-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization inm.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

inm.txt contains digitization of the preface, the concordance,
the body of entries (the index), and corrections.
The following descriptions generally apply to the entries only, not
to the other sections.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 
{#X#}  : Devanagari text in slp1 transcoding. (twice in title section)
{??}   : Unreadable text. about 100 instances.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

<sup>N</sup>  Superscript text; includes homonymns and footnote markers.
<F>X</F>      Footnote.  Footnotes appear at the end of entries.
Often line breaks have semantic significance, such as indicating the
   row of a table. Three types of line break divisions are indicated, although
   the distinction among these types is not currently understood.
<div n="lb">  Line break
<div n="P">   Line break with indentation
<div n="HI">  Line break - Possible list of headwords; 22 instances.
<C n="N">  (N=1,2,3,4,5,6).  Indicates columns in a tabular display. 200 instances.
<lang n="greek"></lang>  Uncoded Greek text

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>1<pc>001-1<k1>abala<k2>abala
{@Abala.@}¦ § 492 (Āṅgirasa): III, {@220,@} 14166 (one of the
<div n="lb">15 {%yajñamuṣo devāḥ,%} gods that rob the offering, created by
<div n="lb">{%Agni Pāñcajanya%}(?)).
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (a digit sequence). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks within the Entries are more specifically coded as
[PagePPP-C +NN] where
PPP is the page number, and
C is a column indicator (a,b)
NN is the number of lines in the original digitization of the entry. 

In sections other than the main entries section, page numbers may have
a different form.

Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.

This generally agrees with the printed text, except:
We use 'ṃ' for anusvara, instead of the author's ṁ.
We use 'ṣ' for the cerebral sibilant, instead of the author's 'sh'
We use 'ś' for the palatal sibilant, instead of the author's 'ç'.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in inm.txt (within entries only):
