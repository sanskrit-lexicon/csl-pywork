Jul 14, 2017  (meta-line format)

This describes details of the coding of the md.txt digitization after
the major recoding of 2017.

This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

md.txt also uses the utf-8 encoding.

One type of markup uses curly braces of the form {Y...Y}, where Y
is one of #,@,% or ?. The meanings:
{#X#}   devanagari text, coded with SLP1 transliteration
{@X@}   bold text
{%X%}   italic text 
{??}    unreadable text (only 1 instance)

Page-column breaks are on separate lines, and coded as [PageX-C].
The first Page number is [Page1-1] occurring on line 7 of md.txt
In general, a page number has form [PageX-C] where X is page number and
C is column number (1,2,or 3).
X is generally a sequence of digits. However, X may be of form
UY, where U is a sequence of digits and Y is 'a','b','c','d', or 'e'; these
forms occur on pages containing headwords starting with more than 1 different
letters.

The lines of the digitization approximately represent lines of the scanned
text.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>1<pc>001-1<k1>a<k2>a<h>1
{#a#}¦a, {%pn.%} {%root used in the inflexion of%} idam 
<>{%and in some particles%}: a-tra, a-tha.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in acc dictionary

Where there is more than one line of text for an entry, the subsequent
lines start with  <> markup.  

There are a small number (8) of Greek text fragments indicated as 
<lang n="greek">X</lang>
where X is Greek text in Unicode characters.

The <lbinfo n="X"/> markup is used to represent certain meta information
about the odd line-break system used in this dictionary. When X contains
a number, it is the number of characters from the end of the preceding
word where a word hyphenation occurs.  When X contains the 2-character
sequence '[]', the line is continued in a bracketed offset section in the
print edition.

Most Sanskrit words appearing in the body of an entry appear in the 
printed text using a combination of IAST  (letter+diacritic) and 
italicized letters.  This is detailed in the Preface as
'Order of the Sanskrit Alphabet', after Page 7 of the Preface.
There is also liberal use of accents.
The main difference in this version of the md.txt digitization is that
both these systems have been replaced by modern IAST coding of Sanskrit.
This coding uses diacritics only.  

There are also some usages of non-ascii characters for other markup purposes.
All the extended ascii characters that occur in the current digitization,
along with their frequencies as of this writing, are shown below.
