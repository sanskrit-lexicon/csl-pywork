bur-meta2.txt
July 28, 2017. This supercedes bur-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization bur.txt.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  19902  := Devanagari, coded in SLP1 transliteration
{%X%}  71661  := italic
{??}      16  := unreadable 
{@@}     161  := bold

The <> style of coding is used as follows:
<lang n="greek"></lang>  669 := greek text (not coded but identified)
<H>       48  := Header (letter change)
<P>    14887  := Sub-headwords identified by <P>{%...%}
There are a few (< 100) other instances of <P>, indicating a
paragraph break in the text.
<lbinfo n="N"/> : the prior word has a line break at the Nth character
  The lines of the digitization generally represent 'sections' of the text; the
  actual line-breaks of the text are not coded.
  However, there is markup corresponding to line breaks in the middle of a word.
  For instance 'déclinables <lbinfo n="4"/>' indicates that there was a line
  break in the word 'déclinables' occurring 4 characters back, 
  e.g. 'déclina-bles'.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>11<pc>005,2<k1>akara<k2>akara
{#akara#}¦ {%akara%} a. {%(kara)%} sans main, manchot. <lbinfo n="5"/> || Inactif
{%(kṛ).%}

<P>{%akaraṇi%} m. état de manchot, t. d'imprécation. <lbinfo n="7"/>
<LEND>


The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in bur dictionary.

The general form of a page break is [PageX-C] where
X = PPP is the page number, and C = 1 or 2 is the column number.
For pages with one or more letter breaks, X may have the form PPPY,
where Y is 'a' or 'b'.
There are two missing (presumed blank) pages, 633 and 634, which 
appear in digitization as [Page633] and [Page634].
The first page number of the dictionary body is 005-1.


Italicized Sanskrit in the body of the entries has been converted to IAST unicode,
 generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. This differs in several respects from the
coding of the printed version.

Unicode also is used to code the diacriticals in French text.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in bur.txt in this coding,
with their approximate frequency.
