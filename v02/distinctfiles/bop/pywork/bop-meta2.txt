bop-meta2.txt
Feb 2, 2018

This supercedes bop-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization bop.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

bop.txt contains digitization of the preface, the body of entries,
and an appendix of corrections.  
The following descriptions apply to the entries only, but may not apply
to the preface or appendices.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari text
{%X%}  : italic text 

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<sup>N</sup>  Footnote indicator
<F>X</F>      Footnote.  Footnotes appear at the end of entries.
Often line breaks have semantic significance, such as indicating the
   row of a table. Three types of line break divisions are indicated, although
   the distinction among these types is not currently understood.
<div n="lb">  Line break
<div n="pfx">  Line break at a prefix within then entry fora root
<lang n="greek"> Greek text. This text is not code as of 02-02-2018.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>1<pc>001-a<k1>a<k2>a<h>1
1. {#a#}¦ stirps demonstrativa; v. gr. 270.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). [Currently not used]

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PagePPP-C+ NN] where
PPP is the page number, and
C is usually 'a' or 'b' (first or second column).
NN is the number of lines in the original digitization of the entry.  
Some pages are coded as
[PagePPP-zC+ NN], where 'z' is 1,2 or 3; these are cases of 'letter breaks',
where words ending with one letter end, and words ending with the next letter
begin.

Headwords are in Devanagari, and Devanagari also appears within the body of
entries.
The Devanagari text is coded in SLP1, within the {#X#} markup, as mentioned.


Latin letters with diacritics appears in the text for some Sanskrit words,
which are often modified to some Latinate form; no attempt has been made to
adjust these spellings to conventions of modern IAST.  

Latin letters with diacritics also represent words from European languages,
such as Russian, Lithuanian, and many others. 

All such letters with diacritics are represented with Unicode characters.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in bop.txt: 
with their frequency as of this writing 02-02-2018.
