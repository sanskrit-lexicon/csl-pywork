acc-meta2.txt
Apr 5, 2017. This supercedes acc-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization acc.txt.
May 25, 2017. 'meta' lines added to acc.txt.

acc.txt uses the utf-8 encoding for extended ASCII characters.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}    49906 : Devanagari, coded in SLP1 transliteration
{%X%}    1461 : italic text 
{??}     22 : unreadable text
{@X@}    1 : bold text. in a header

The following  <> type tags are found in acc.txt:
<HI>  53695  : Marks headwords
<>  30653  : start of new line
<P>  166  :  start of new line
<HI1>  26991  : start of new line
<H>  52  : Title line
<F>..</F>  24  : Footnote

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>22<pc>1-001,1<k1>akzarasvIkAraprayoga<k2>akzarasvIkAraprayoga
{#akzarasvIkAraprayoga#}¦ dh. Burnell 151^a.
<LEND>
The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in acc dictionary

---------------------------------

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PageV-PPP-C+ N] or [PageV-PPP+ N].
The [PageV-PPP-C+ N] form is the usual form; in this form,
 V is the volume (1,2 or 3)
 PPP is page within volume
 C is column, usually 'a' or 'b'; sometimes 'a1' or 'b1'
 N is usu. a number with 1 or 2 digits (number of lines in following column)
   Occasionally, it is 'No' (in Corrections sections).
The [PageV-PPP+ N] form is used for title, preface pages.

The lines of the digitization represent lines of the text.

Headwords are coded in the general form <HI>{#X#}¦
where X is coded in SLP1 transliteration.

The headwords are ordered according to Sanskrit alphabet ordering,
within each volume.


Non-Devanagari Sanskrit in the body of the entries has been converted 
to IAST unicode, generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. 
This differs in several respects from the coding of the printed version.


Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in acc.txt,
with their approximate frequency.
