ccs-meta2.txt
Dec 28, 2017

This supercedes ccs-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization ccs.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari text, X is in SLP1 transcoding.
{%X%}  : italic text 

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

<lbinfo n="N"/> related to line breaks occurring within a word.
Hypothetical example. Suppose text has these two lines:
blah blah a sep-
arated word.
We recode this as
blah blah a separated <lbinfo n="6"/>
word.
6 is the number of characters on the next line, after the separation.
The hyphen due to separation is omitted.

<H>  A 'headline'.  E.g., at the letter break for second letter 'A',
     we have <H>{#A#}.
     Such coding occurs OUTSIDE of entries.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>2<pc>001-1<k1>a<k2>a,<h>2
2. {#a,#}¦ {#an#} {#(°—)#} {%negat. Präfix -un, vor Subst.,%}
{%Adj., Adv., Partic. u. Ger.; selten vor%}
{%Inf. und Verb. fin.%}
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PagePPP-C] where
PPP is page number.   
C   is column number.  Ususally 1 or 2. However, for pages where a letter
   break occurs within the page,  the value of C differs.  For instance,
   At the letter break 'A', there are two parts corresponding to the 
   last few entries of 'a' words and the first few entries of 'b' words.
   [Page038-1]  marks the beginning of the first column of the top part.
   [Page038-2]  marks the second column of the top part
   [Page038-1a] marks the first column of the bottom part (A words)
   [Page038-2a] marks the second column of the bottom part.

Words using diacritics with the Latin alphabet are represented in Unicode 
characters.  Except for the German words, there are only about 700+ such words 
in this dictionary, and our working assumption is that they are Sanskrit words.
we think they are Sanskrit words. We have thus represented the diacritics of
these supposed Sanskrit words according to modern IAST unicode,
generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration; 
the usage of diacritics in the printed text has zome differences from
the modern IAST appearing in this version of the digitization.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in ccs.txt, including
those IAST letters,
with their  frequency as of this writing (12-28-2017):
