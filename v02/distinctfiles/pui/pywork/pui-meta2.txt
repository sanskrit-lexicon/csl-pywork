pui-meta2.txt
Feb 16, 2018

This supercedes pui-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization pui.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

pui.txt contains digitization of the entries of the three volumes,
along with the title pages of volumes 2 and 3. The introductory material
from volume 1 is not currently part of the digitization.

The following descriptions generally apply to the entry sections only, not
to the other sections. 

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{%X%}  : italic text 
{#X#}  : Devanagari text in slp1 transcoding. Only 3 instances. 
{??}   : Unreadable text. 6 instances.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

Types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb"/>  Line break
<div n="P"/>   Line break with indentation
<sup>N</sup>   Reference to footnote N of an entry
<F>N)X</F>     Text of footnote N

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>1<pc>1-001<k1>aMkuSA<k2>aMkuSA
{%Aṃkuśā%}¦ — a Śakti on the Drāviṇikā mudrā.
<div n="P"/>Br. IV. 36. 76.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number. Expressed in Roman numerals.

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks have the form [PageV-PPP+ n], where
V is the volume (1,2 or 3)
PPP is the page (within volume)
n is the number of lines in the new page


The lines of the digitization generally represent lines of the text.

 The headwords for these entries are in Sanskrit alphabetical order.

Most Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.

This generally agrees with the printed text, except one instance
of Ḷ (as a headword), whose significance is unclear as of this writing.


The extended ascii characters appearing in the digitization, along
with their frequency as of 02-16-2018, are:
