gst-meta2.txt
Feb 6, 2018

This supercedes gst-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization gst.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

gst.txt contains digitization of the preface and the body of entries.
Within the entries, there are two correction sections, two additional
title pages, and a section of books by the publisher.  These sections are
marked by comment lines starting with a semicolon character.

The following descriptions apply to the entries only, not
to the other sections.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 
{#X#}  : Devanagari text, coded in SLP1 transcoding.
{??}   : missing text; some of these are metrical symbols.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<s>X</s> Sanskrit text, in SLP1 transcoding.
<sup>N</sup>  Section indicator within entry
<div n="lb">  Line break. The digitization has a line for each line of text.
<div n="P">   Line break with indentation.
<lang n="greek"></lang>  Greek text, not coded (on 11 lines).

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>1<pc>001-a<k1>a<k2>a
{#a#}¦ I. The letter {%ă,%} the first of the alphabet and the short
<div n="lb">vowel inherent in every consonant. See {#akAra#}.
 ...
<LEND>


The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (roman numerals).

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PagePPP-C +NN] where
PPP is the page number, and
C identifies the columns as 'a' or 'b'.
NN is the number of lines in the original digitization of the entry.  

The text only contains 6780 headwords, from 'a' to 'aByAhita'.

All of the headwords and text of entries are in either Devanagari or English,
or the author's version of IAST (letters with diacritics).
The Devanagari text is coded in SLP1, within the <s> tag, as mentioned.
We have converted the IAST text into an approximation of modern IAST, as
described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.   This conversion to modern form is incomplete in several details.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in gst.txt (within entries only):
