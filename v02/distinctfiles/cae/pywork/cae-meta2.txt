cae-meta2.txt
Oct 30, 2017

This supercedes cae-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization cae.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari text, X is in SLP1 transcoding.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<ab>X</ab>  general abbreviation. The expansion is from a separate table.
<ab n="Y">X</ab> local abbreviation Y is the expansion of X. Not currently used.
<lang n="greek">X</lang>  word in Greek unicode  (2 instances)
<lex>X</lex>   163624 X = a, m,n,f
<div n="p">    7942 prefix used with the root 


Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>2<pc>001<k1>a<k2>a<h>2
2 {#a#}¦ {#an#} neg. prefix, corresponding to Gr. <lang n="greek">ἀ ἀν</lang>, Lat. in, Germ.
un, <ab>etc.</ab>
<LEND>


The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
  e  firstalt.  This entry is first of two or more alternate spellings, which
     have been encoded as separate entries in cae.txt. 
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PagePPP] where
PPP is page number

Words using diacritics with the Latin alphabet are represented in Unicode 
characters.  Such words identified as Sanskrit are enclosed in the <is> tag,
and the spelling aims to be modern IAST unicode,
generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.
