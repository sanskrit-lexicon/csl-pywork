pe-meta2.txt
Feb 13, 2018

This supercedes pe-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization pe.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

pe.txt contains digitization of the entries, and the genealogy appendix.
The following descriptions generally apply to the entry sections only, not
to the other sections. The title page, foreward and preface are not part
of the pe.txt digitization.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 
{#X#}  : Devanagari text in slp1 transcoding. (8 in title section, 2 in entries)
{??}   : Unreadable text. 19 instances.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

Types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb"/>  Line break
<div n="P"/>   Line break with indentation, rare.
<div n="NI"/>  Line break without indentation, common.
<F>X</F>       Footnote inserted at position of reference.
<Poem>X</Poem> 
<C n="N"/>     A column break, for tabular text.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>2<pc>001-a<k1>abala<k2>abala
ABALA¦ is one of the fifteen devas who were the sons of
<div n="lb"/>Pāñcajanya. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 22, Verse 11).
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (roman numerals). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
There are two forms.
First form:
[PagePPP-C+ n] where PPP is page number from 001 to 900,
               and C is column (a or b)
Second form (GENEALOGY section)
[PagePPP+ n]  PPP = 901 to 922 (single column material)
 

Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.

This generally agrees with the printed text, except:
We use 'ṃ' for anusvara, instead of the author's ṁ.

The headwords are alphabetized in order of the Latin (English) alphabet.

The extended ascii characters appearing in the digitization, along
with their frequency as of 02-13-2018, are:
