snp-meta2.txt
Feb 19, 2018

This supercedes snp-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization snp.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

snp.txt contains digitization of the entries, along with  other
sections of the two part work.
The following descriptions generally apply to the entry sections only, not
to the other sections. 

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{%X%}  : italic text 

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

Types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb"/>  Line break
<div n="P"/>   Line break with indentation
<div n="HI"/>   Line break of second type. 3 instances.
<bot>X</bot>   Scientific names. Only in part 1.
<lang n="greek"></lang>  Greek text, uncoded in digitization

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>8<pc>524<k1>atasI<k2>atasI
{%atasī%}¦
<div n="lb"/><bot>LINUM USITATISSIMUM LINN.</bot>
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (no instances in snp.txt). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
In general, a page break has form [PageX+ n] where X is page number and
n is the number of lines in the digitization for page X.
The forms of X are:
title-Y   (Y = v,VI)
-PPP    where PPP = 520 to 611 for first part
              PPP = 425 to 465 for second part
In SNP, these page numbers refer to parts of two different publications,
as indicated in snpheader.xml.

The lines of the digitization generally represent lines of the text.

The headwords for the entries are in Sanskrit dictionary alphabetical order.

Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.

This agrees with the printed text.

Some letters with diacritics are also used to represent words in other languages.

The extended ascii characters appearing in the digitization, along
with their frequency as of 02-19-2018, are:
