sch-meta2.txt
June 22, 2017
This file describes the coding conventions of sch.txt, which is the current
version of the Schfey digitization. For previous versions, see sch-meta.txt.

sch.txt uses the utf-8 encoding for extended ASCII characters.

Here is the first record of sch.txt, to serve as an example for the following
descriptions:
<L>1<pc>001-1<k1>a<k2>a°
{#a#} {%a°%}¦ {!2!}  , {%asvaptum%} Tāṇḍya-Br. 10 , 4 , 4. {part=,seq=1,type=,n=1}
<LEND>


The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{# #}  29114  : {#X#} Only used in headword part of records. See below.
{% %}  57590  : italic text (primarily, perhaps entirely, used for
                Sanskrit text)
{! !}    492  : Homonym number for word in PWK dictionary
{part=,seq=1,type=,n=1} : This exemplifies a coding that appears for
 each entry, at the end of the body of the entry.  
 - part  when blank, the entry occurs in the main part of the dictionary
         when 'N', the entry occurs in the supplement (German Nachtrag).
 - seq  a sequence number for the entry in the original digitization. 
   For about 350 cases of homonyms merged in the original digitization, 
   a variant of this might be, e.g., seq=6109a.
 - type - Some entries appear with a preceding code (*, º, +). 
    For example, ºaMSumatPala, *aMSumatPalA, *+jyotiriNgaRa.
 - n This is the number of lines taken by the entry in the printed edition.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. 

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
    Note: L is usually 'close' to the value of the 'seq' parameter
     mentioned above.
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, in IAST
optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in wil dictionary


Page and Column breaks are coded as [PageX]; they appear on separate lines
of sch.txt. The forms of X are:
PPP.C   3-digit page number, 0-filled. Column number is 1,2 or 3
PPPa.C  in 45-cases. These occur where words starting with a new letter
 appear within a page. The 'a' indicates that this is the 2nd horizontal
 section of the page. For example, look at page 104.

The lines of the digitization do NOT correspond to the lines of the printed 
text. Rather, in general, a single entry is represented by a single line of
the digitization;  exceptions to this rule may occur when a page-column break
occurs within the body of an entry.

All of the Sanskrit in the text appears in the European Indological form,
which we think is actually identical to the modern IAST Unicode form
as described in the reference
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. 

It is beleived that most Sanskrit words appears within italics coded as
{%X%}. Known exception:
 - literary source references, usually abbreviated.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in sch.txt,
with their approximate frequency.  Although most of these appear within 
Sanskrit words, a few (e.g. ï) appear within words of other languages, and a few
(such as ¦, which is markup) serve some specialized purpose.
