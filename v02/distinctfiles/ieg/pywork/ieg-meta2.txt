ieg-meta2.txt
Feb  8, 2018

This supercedes ieg-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization ieg.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

ieg.txt contains digitization of the preface, the body of entries,
three appendices, a correction section, and an index.
The following descriptions apply to the entries section and the appendices,
but not to the other sections. [Currently, the headwords of ieg.txt also 
include those of the appendices.]


The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari, coded in slp1. Only occurs in the transliteration 
         section of the preface.
{%X%}  : italic text 
{??}   : two places with unreadable text.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<div n="lb">  Line break
<div n="P">   Line break, indented.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>3<pc>001<k1>abAtamAla<k2>abAtamAla, abAtamAlA
{%abātamāla, abātamālā,%}¦ Prakrit; meaning doubtful (cf. {%Ep.%}
<div n="lb">{%Ind.,%} Vol. XV, p. 272; {%ZDMG,%} Vol. XL, pp. 345-46); explained
<div n="lb">as a kind of sculptured slab (LL).
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number. Not present in this work.
NOTE: For numerous entries (including the 700+ entries of the three appendices),
  the headword is not Sanskrit.  Nonetheless, k1 and k2 are coded as if the
  words were Sanskrit. This confusing situation is currently an unsolved
  problem with the ieg.txt digitization.

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PageX nn], where nn is the number of following
lines on page X.
X has one of the regular expression forms: 
 -([ivx]+)  for preface pages.  X from 'iii' to 'xvi'
 -([0-9]+)  001-442  bulk of dictionary, 556-564 for post-index matters
  ([0-9]+[ab])  for index pages (which have two columns, 'a' or 'b')
       442-555

The lines of the digitization represent lines of the text.  The headwords
are in approximate English alphabetical order; the main entries and the
entries of the appendices are separately alphabetized.


All of the entry headwords, and many of the headwords in the appendices, are coded 
in ieg.txt with approximately modern IAST Unicode, as described in
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.

We use 'ṃ' for anusvara, instead of the author's ṁ.
Several Dravidian characters appear in the print with the diacritic marking of diaresis
(two dots) below the Latin character;  We have used the preformed unicode characters
which have a line beneath the Latin character.  There is one character which occurs about
100 times which is described as 'Dravidian cerebral voiced  fricative' and appears in print
as an ell 'l' with three under-dots; finding no good Unicode way to present this, we have
left it in the form '113' of the original digitization.

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in ieg.txt 
with their  frequency as of this writing 02-08-2018.  (This tabulation includes text
found in the preface and index, as well as in the text of headwords.)
