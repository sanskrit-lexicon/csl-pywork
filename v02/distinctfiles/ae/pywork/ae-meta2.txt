ae-meta2.txt
Mar 13, 2018

This supercedes ae-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization ae.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

ae.txt contains digitization of the entire text consisting of front matter,
entries, and appendix.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari text, in SLP1 transliteration
{%X%}  : italic text 
{@X@}  : bold text
{??}   : 3 instances, in preface and appendix.

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

Types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb"/>  Line break

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>3<pc>001<k1>abase<k2>abase
{@Abase,@}¦ {%v. t.%} {#aBiBU#} 1 P, {#svasTAnAt nipat#}
<div n="lb"/>c., {#apakfz#} 1 P, {#laGUkf#} 8 U. {@-ment,@} {%s.%}
<div n="lb"/>{#apakarzaH, aBiBavaH, mAnaBaMgaH, avajYAnaM#}.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (not present in ae.txt). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PageP] where P is 1,2,...502.  (page 502 is Appendix)
Page breaks of the preface are marked [Pagex1],...,[Pagex12].

The lines of the digitization represent lines of the text.

The headwords for the entries are in English alphabetical order.

Sanskrit words are represented in Devanagari, which is coded as {#X#},
where X is is SLP1 transliteration.

Sanskrit words within the entries appear in IAST form only a handful of times.

The extended ascii characters appearing in the digitization, along
with their frequency as of 03-13-2018, are:
