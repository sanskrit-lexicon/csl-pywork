pd-meta2.txt
Feb 4, 2018

This supercedes pd-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization pd.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari text, in SLP1 transcoding
{@X@}  : bold text
{%X%}  : italic text 
{??}   : unreadable text (occurs in 784 lines as of 02-04-2018)

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 
<div n="lb">  line break
<sup>n</sup>  Homonym numbers in text, displayed as html 'sup' (superscript)

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>1<pc>1-0001a<k1>a<k2>a<h>1
<sup>1</sup>{#a#}¦ (a) the first letter of the Devanāgarī alphabet. All {%Akṣarasamā-%}
<div n="lb">{%mnāyas%} begin with it. cf. ŚivSū.(Gr.) 1. The NandiKāśi. on it (vv. 3-9)
 ...  MANY MORE LINES
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (usually a digit). 

Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
Page breaks are more specifically coded as
[PageV-PPPP-C+ NN] where
V is volumne (1-8)
PPPP is page number (consecutive through the volumes)
C  is column (a or b)
NN is the number of lines in the column of the page.   
The lines in the entry bodies correspond to lines of printed text.
For pages with a letter break per page, the coding is
[PagePPP-1C+ NN]; similarly if there are 2 or 3 letter breaks in a page.

Words using diacritics with the Latin alphabet are represented in Unicode 
characters. The vast majority of such words with diacritics are Sanskrit.
There are also several words in German, French, etc. with diacritics.
The Sanskrit words are not distinguished typographically from words in English
or other languages.

The spelling aims to be modern IAST unicode,
generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration; the use of diacritics in the printed text already
corresponds almost exactly with that of modern IAST with one main exception:
The text uses ṁ (m with dot above) for Sanskrit anusvara;  we have changed
this to ṃ (m with dot below) to agree with modern IAST as described.


Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in the text.
with their  frequency as of this writing (01-30-2018):

£  (\u00a3)  1067 := POUND SIGN
   This represents non-combining chandra-bindu in transcoding of Devanagari;
   We don't know how to represent this with Unicode.
¦  (\u00a6) 107630 := BROKEN BAR
   end of raw headword in first line of each entry.
   The last headword is apacaya.
