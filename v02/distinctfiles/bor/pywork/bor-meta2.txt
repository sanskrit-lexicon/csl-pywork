bor-meta2.txt
Feb 23, 2018

This supercedes bor-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization bor.txt.

The digitization is in the utf-8 encoding.

bor.txt contains digitization of the entries of the two volumes of the text;
the front matter is not part of the digitization.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes:
{#X#}  : Devanagari text, in SLP1 transliteration
{%X%}  : italic text 
{@X@}  : bold text - used to delimit headwords.
{??}   : Unreadable text. 3 instances

The pseudo-xml <> style of coding is used as follows:

<L>,<e>,<h>,<k1>,<k2>,<pc>,<LEND> are used in the 'meta lines' (see below) 

Types of line break divisions appear in the entries:
<div n="lb"/>  Line break
<div n="1"/>X</div>   Subsection delimited by a number: (1), (2), etc.
<div n="I"/>X</div>   Subsection delimited by a roman numeral: I, II, etc.
<div n="xe">X</div>  <div n="xs">Y</div>  Indicates a usage example;
               X is English italics; Y is Sanskrit Devanagari.
               This markup is at preliminary stage of accuracy.
<ls>X</ls>     Literary source; this markup incomplete.

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,

<L>5<pc>001<k1>abandonment<k2>abandonment
<div n="lb"/>{@ABANDONMENT:@}¦ <div n="1">(1) {#tyAgaH;#} </div><div n="1">(2) {#parityAgaH;#}</div>
<div n="lb"/><div n="1">(3) {#utsargaH;#} Ph: a. of wordly connexions:
<div n="lb"/>{#sannpAsaH.#}</div>
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. same as k1 for this dictionary.
optional field for homonym
  h The homonym number (not present in bor.txt). 

Page breaks are coded as [PagePPP],
where PPP goes from 001 to 772.
Although there are two columns of text on each page, the column breaks
are not identified.

The lines of the digitization generally represent lines of the text.

The headwords for the entries are in English alphabetical order.

Some Sanskrit words within the entries are presented in modern IAST form, as 
described in  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration.
There are some disagreements with modern IAST (e.g. 'sh' instead of 'ṣ').


The extended ascii characters appearing in the digitization, along
with their frequency as of 02-18-2018, are:
