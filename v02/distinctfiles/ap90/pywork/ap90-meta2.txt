ap90-meta2.txt
July 1, 2017.  This supercedes ap90-meta.txt as a description of 
 the current digitization ap90.txt
-  'meta' lines added to ap90.txt

ap90.txt uses the utf-8 encoding for extended ASCII characters.

This file describes the coding conventions of the data files.
This file is encoded in utf-8 encoding.

The {X...X} style of coding serves several purposes; the counts are approximate.
{# #}  116049  : {#X#} devanagari text, coded in SLP1 transliteration
{@X@}    137307 : bold text  
{%X%}     40595 : italic text 
{|X|}         5 : widely spaced text
{??}         20 : unreadable or uncoded text 

Meta lines: 
Each entry of the digitization is contained within a beginning and ending
markup. As example,
<L>2<pc>0001-c<k1>afRin<k2>afRin
{#afRin#}¦ {%a.%} ({#f#} being regarded as
<>a consonant) Not a debtor, free from
<>debt; {#divasasyAzwame BAge SAkaM pacati yo#}
<>{#naraH . afRI cApravAsI ca sa vAricara#}
<>{#modate ..#} Mb. The form {#anfRin#} also
<>occurs in this sense.
<LEND>

The ending markup is <LEND>.
The beginning markup contains various identifying fields, expressed in
a <fieldname>fieldvalue format. The fields are:
required fields
  L Cologne record identifier
  pc page-col reference to scanned image
  k1 key1. The headword spelling, in slp1 coding for Sanskrit headwords
  k2 key2. The original headword spelling, either in slp1 or IAST

optional field for homonym
  hom The homonym number (usually a digit). Not present in wil dictionary


Other markup:
<>  :   begins most lines.  Indicates a line break. 
<H>  86 :  A title line of some sort, such as for letter break
<P> 232 : An indented paragraph. Mostly in the digitization of preface.
<NI>  1 : similar to <P>

Each line of the digitization corresponds to a line of the printed text.


Page breaks are coded as [Page...].
In general, a page number has form [PageX+ n], where X identifies the
subsequent page and column and n is the number of lines of text on that
page and column. (for blank pages, n = 'No')
Here are the forms of X
In preface
  -I,-II
  -1 through -6
  7-a through 9-b
  10  (Here n = 'No' - a blank page)
 11-a through 13-1b
In body of text,
 PPPP-C  where PPPP is 4-digit page number (0001 - 1178)
         and C is usually 'a','b','c' but may be '1a',etc or '2a',etc.
 Occasionally, the form is 
 PPPP--C 
In Appendices, the form is as in body:
 PPPP-C  where PPPP is from 1179 to 1196


Non-Devanagari Sanskrit in the body of the entries has been converted 
to IAST unicode, generally as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration. 
In this process, the spellings of many words has been modernized, and 
gratuitous variations of spelling have been normalized. 

Here are the extended ASCII characters that occur in wil.txt,
with their approximate frequency.
