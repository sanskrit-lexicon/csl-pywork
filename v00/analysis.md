# hw.py

1. Absent in BEN
2. MW has specific requirement for 'e' tag. Its code is slightly different. May need templating.

This makes it templated, rather than common script.

# hw0.py

1. BEN has separate hw0.py

# hw2.py

1. BEN has separate hw2.py

# hwparse.py

It anyhow has dict = '${dictlo}'.
So, necessary to template.
1. BEN does not have this file.
2. MW has some diff for its unique 'e' tag.

	>                ['e']   # contains HX identifier for mw

# parseheadline.py

1. BEN does not have this file.

# updateByLine.py
